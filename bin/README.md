These are pre-compiled .bin files that are most likely to work for your board.
The file 1616.bin is for the standard Malenki nano Integrated, while the 1616plus is for the Malenki nano Integrated High Voltage

*testing has only been done on the Malenki Nano Integrated High Voltage
*not sure if these files will work on the old multi board Malenki Nanos
